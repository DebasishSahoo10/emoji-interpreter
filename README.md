# Emoji Interpreter
This is React App which is created with CodeSandbox. This app gives you the Fruit Name if you input the fruit emoji or by clicking some emojis which are available in site itself.

> I created this react app with help of Tanay sir. This is my introduction fully functional React. Logic is pretty simple but I learned using database, using react function useState to create a place holder, and connecting database to placeholder on the event of user input. UI : for the first time, I used gradient background image in it.
